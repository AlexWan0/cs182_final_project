This meeting is really going to be about a different kind of friendship than usual.      So far I've heard nothing positive about him.       I don't know whether his relationship will be good, he's been kind, I think, I don't know how many other people would agree to call this meeting.      I would certainly hope I'll learn something from it...        If I hadn't met him, I'd be disappointed.         He was nice, but he didn't deserve that   award...
